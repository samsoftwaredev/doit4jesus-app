And God’s not looking for spectators. He’s raising up warriors. The Rosary trains your soul like spiritual push-ups—building courage, faith, and the guts to stand up for truth, even when it’s hard. \n Pray it daily. Swing it like a sword. And get ready to level up—in holiness, not just in your prayer app.",
