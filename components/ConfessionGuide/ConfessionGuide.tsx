      title: "Contraception, IVF and Abortion.",
      description:
        "Most readers here know that abortion is murder. But many Catholics do not know that contraception (in marriage or out of marriage) is a mortal sin. Both sterilization (of the man or woman) and/or the condom (male or female) is a mortal sin. These must be confessed to enter sanctifying grace.",

    {
      title:
        "Masturbation and/or Pornography, before marriage or within marriage.",
      description:
        "Some saints have pointed out that sins which exacted physical death in the Old Covenant (Judaism) are frequently the sins that cause spiritual death in the New Testament (Catholicism.)",
    },
    {
      title: "Immodesty, Including Wearing Leggings and Short Shorts.",
      description:
        "I could quote countless saints here, but the most succinct description is what the Mother of God said at Fatima: “Certain fashions will be introduced that will offend Our Lord very much.”—Our Lady of Fatima, 1917. What are these certain fashions? If not leggings and short shorts, then what? Strangely, many Catholic women know this quote from Fatima, but they only apply it to women who wear less than themselves.",
    },
    {
      title:
        "Before marriage, making-out or anything more passionate than that.",
      description:
        "St. Thomas Aquinas writes:  “I answer that a thing is said to be a mortal works. One may sin in two ways. First, by reason of its species, and in this way a kiss, caress, or touch does not, of its very nature, imply a mortal sin, for it is possible to do such things without lustful pleasure, either as being the custom of one’s country, or on account of some obligation or reasonable cause.",
    },
    {
      title: "In marriage, anything unnatural.",
      description:
        "The two greatest moral theologians of the Church, St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Alphonsus Ligouri both teach that anal sex in marriage is a mortal sin.  Even Catholic Answers once had an article explaining that any form of insertion-based oral-sex is a mortal sin—even in marriage.",
